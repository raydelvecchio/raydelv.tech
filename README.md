# Ray Del Vecchio's Website
Website found at [raydelv.tech](https://raydelv.tech). Made with React. 

# Notes
* `raydelv.tech/public/_redirects` tells Netlify to use React router's default redirect, not Netlify's
* `raydelv.tech/public/robots.txt` defines how bots/crawlers/scrapers interact with the site (not optimized yet)

# TODO
* Sections for the following:
  * About (where I'm from, school, moving around as a kid, playing with computers in elementary school now I do for a living)
  * Projects / Code work (nima, raverec, swiftai, many other small projects, TA for DL)
  * Research (ISEF, object states, SUS encoding)
  * Investing (Nima, personally pfizer/moderna/AMD/palantir, BHIG, BSRE, skilldeck angel investment)
