# Ray Del Vecchio's Website
Website found at [raydelv.tech](https://raydelv.tech). Made with React. 

# Notes
* `raydelv.tech/public/_redirects` tells Netlify to use React router's default redirect, not Netlify's
* `raydelv.tech/public/robots.txt` defines how bots/crawlers/scrapers interact with the site (not optimized yet)
